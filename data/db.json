      "bio": "David Robert Jones 8 January 1947  10 January 2016 known professionally as David Bowie boʊi BOH ee was an English singer songwriter and actor A leading figure in the music industry he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music   Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963 Space Oddity released in 1969 was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single Starman and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars which won him widespread popularity. In 1975 Bowies style shifted towards a sound he characterised as plastic soul initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single Fame and the album Young Americans In 1976 Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977 he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy Heroes (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise"
